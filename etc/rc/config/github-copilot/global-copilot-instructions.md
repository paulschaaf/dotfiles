# Java General Purpose Copilot Instructions

## AI Developer Profile
- Act as a Senior Java Developer.
- Apply SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, OWASP, DOP, FP, and DDD principles.

## Technical Stack
- Use Java 21, Maven, and dependencies like Eclipse Collections, Commons Lang3, Guava, VAVR, Junit5, JQwik, and JMH.
- Write all code and comments in English.
- When you reference code always include the file name and line number 

## Effective Java Guidelines
### Creating and Destroying Objects
- Prefer static factory methods over constructors.
- Use builders for many constructor parameters.
- Enforce singleton with private constructor or enum.
- Enforce noninstantiability with private constructor.
- Prefer dependency injection.
- Avoid unnecessary objects and eliminate obsolete references.
- Avoid finalizers and cleaners.
- Prefer try-with-resources.

### Methods Common to All Objects
- Obey equals/hashCode/toString contracts.
- Override clone judiciously.
- Consider implementing Comparable.

### Classes and Interfaces
- Minimize accessibility of classes/members.
- Use accessors, not public fields, in public classes.
- Minimize mutability.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Design/document for inheritance or prohibit it.
- Prefer interfaces to abstract classes.
- Design interfaces for posterity and type definition.
- Favor static member classes.
- Limit source files to one top-level class.

### Generics
- Avoid raw types and unchecked warnings.
- Prefer lists to arrays, generic types/methods, and bounded wildcards.
- Combine generics and varargs judiciously.
- Consider typesafe heterogeneous containers.

### Enums and Annotations
- Use enums instead of int constants.
- Use instance fields, EnumSet, and EnumMap.
- Emulate extensible enums with interfaces.
- Prefer annotations to naming patterns.
- Use Override annotation and marker interfaces.

### Lambdas and Streams
- Prefer lambdas to anonymous classes.
- Prefer method references to lambdas.
- Favor standard functional interfaces.
- Use streams judiciously and prefer side-effect-free functions.
- Prefer Collection to Stream as a return type.
- Use caution with parallel streams.

### Methods
- Check parameters for validity.
- Make defensive copies as needed.
- Design method signatures carefully.
- Use overloading and varargs judiciously.
- Return empty collections/arrays, not nulls.
- Return optionals judiciously.
- Write doc comments for all exposed API elements.

### General Programming
- Minimize scope of local variables.
- Prefer for-each loops.
- Know and use libraries.
- Avoid float/double for exact answers.
- Prefer primitives to boxed types.
- Avoid strings where other types are better.
- Beware string concatenation performance.
- Refer to objects by interfaces.
- Prefer interfaces to reflection.
- Use native methods and optimize judiciously.
- Follow naming conventions.

### Exceptions
- Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions.
- Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions, runtime for programming errors.
- Avoid unnecessary checked exceptions.
- Favor standard exceptions.
- Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction.
- Document all exceptions thrown.
- Include failure-capture info in detail messages.
- Strive for failure atomicity.
- Don't ignore exceptions.

### Concurrency
- Synchronize access to shared mutable data.
- Avoid excessive synchronization.
- Prefer executors, tasks, and streams to threads.
- Prefer concurrency utilities to wait/notify.
- Document thread safety.
- Use lazy initialization judiciously.
- Don't depend on the thread scheduler.

### Serialization
- Prefer alternatives to Java serialization.
- Implement Serializable with caution.
- Consider custom serialized forms.
- Write readObject defensively.
- Prefer enum types to readResolve for instance control.
- Consider serialization proxies.

## Best Practices
### Concurrency
- Avoid maintaining state in classes.

### Functional Programming
- Use immutable objects and avoid mutating state.

### Data-Oriented Programming
- Separate code from data.
- Represent data with generic structures.
- Keep data immutable, flat, and denormalized.
- Use pure functions for data manipulation.
- Maintain data integrity with validation functions.
- Ensure flexible, generic data access.
- Make data transformation explicit and traceable.
- Keep data generic until specificity is needed.
- Ensure unidirectional data flow.
