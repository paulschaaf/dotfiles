"WELCOME TO ZORK!

ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will explore
some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No computer should be
without one!"

>n
North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all
the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.

>s
The windows are all boarded.

>e
Behind House
You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one
corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

>open windoew
I don't know the word "windoew".

>open window
With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

>in
Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east
is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water

  A quantity of water

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

>take lamp
Taken.

>look at lamp
The lamp is turned off.

There's nothing special about the sword.

>take
(sword)
Taken.

>take
What do you want to take?

>rug
The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.

>move rug
With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the
dusty cover of a closed trap door.

>open door
Which door do you mean, the wooden door or the trap door?

>trap
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

>score
Your score is 10 (total of 350 points), in 19 moves.
This gives you the rank of Beginner.

>e

A bottle is sitting on the table.

  A quantity of water

>u
You have moved into a dark place.
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

>turn on lamp
The brass lantern is now on.

Attic
This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down.
A large coil of rope is lying in the corner.
On a table is a nasty-looking knife.

>>w
Living Room

>d
The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a
crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is
unclimbable.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

>s
East of Chasm
You are on the east edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. A
narrow passage goes north, and the path you are on continues to the east.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

>e
Gallery
This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings have been stolen by vandals with
exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far
wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.

>n
Studio
This appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are
splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of
value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an open door (also
covered with paint). A dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace;
although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back
down.
Loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper.

>take paper
Taken.
