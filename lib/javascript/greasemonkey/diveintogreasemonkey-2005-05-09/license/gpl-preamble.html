               <p>      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
                  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
                  intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
                  free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
                        This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
                        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit 
                        to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
                        by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
                        to your programs, too.
                      
               </p>
               <p>      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
                        Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
                        freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
                        service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
                        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
                        programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                      
               </p>
               <p>      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
                        to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
                        restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
                        copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                      
               </p>
               <p>      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
                        for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
                        must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
                        must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                      
               </p>
               <p>      We protect your rights with two steps:
                        
               </p>
               <div class="orderedlist">
                  <ol type="1">
                     <li>	    copyright the software, and
                        	  
                     </li>
                     <li>	    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
                        	    distribute and/or modify the software.
                        	  
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </div>
               <p>
                      
               </p>
               <p>      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
                        everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If 
                        the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its 
                        recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any 
                        problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' 
                        reputations.
                      
               </p>
               <p>      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
                        We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
                        individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
                        proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
                        licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
